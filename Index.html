      <h2>Selected Projects</h2>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Code Review Simulation</h3>
        <p>This project analyzes data from Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, to identify patterns in trips, key companies, and the most relevant neighborhoods, as well as to evaluate the impact of weather on trip durations. It includes an exploratory data analysis and a hypothesis test to determine whether trips from the Loop to Oâ€™Hare International Airport take longer on rainy Saturdays, using statistical tools and visualizations to generate conclusions and strategic recommendations to optimize the service.</p>

        <h3>Marketing Analysis for Showz</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on optimizing marketing spend for Showz, a ticketing company, by examining user behavior and evaluating acquisition strategies. It involves an exploratory analysis of website visits and orders, using three primary datasets (website visits, orders, and marketing costs). Key goals include analyzing user trends (visits, sessions, purchases), calculating acquisition cost (CAC) and return on marketing investment (ROMI), and identifying the most cost-effective acquisition sources. The workflow includes data preparation with pandas, cleaning and type optimization, followed by visual analytics and insights aimed at maximizing marketing ROI.</p>

        <h3>A/B Testing for Online Store</h3>
        <p>In this project, I analyzed a series of marketing hypotheses from an online storeâ€™s marketing department to determine which ideas should be prioritized based on their potential revenue impact. To do this, I applied two prioritization frameworksâ€”ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) and RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort). Next, I conducted a detailed A/B test analysis to evaluate whether the selected hypotheses significantly affected the storeâ€™s key metrics.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>User Behavior Analysis</h3>
        <p>I analyzed user interactions within a food e-commerce app by examining event logs over a two-week period. The first part focused on a conversion funnel analysis, revealing how users progress through key screensâ€”Main Screen â†’ Offers â†’ Cart â†’ Paymentâ€”and identifying the main drop-off point between the Main Screen and the Offers screen, while noting a high conversion rate (94.8%) once users reached the cart. The second part involved an A/A/B test comparing two control groups (original font) against an experimental group (new font). Statistical tests confirmed no significant differences in user behavior, validating both the experimental design and the conclusion that the font change does not impact user interaction.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Client Retention at Model Fitness</h3>
        <p>I analyzed customer data from Model Fitness, a gym chain, to study membership retention and churn patterns. The first part involved examining client activity and demographics to identify factors influencing cancellations, such as age, class frequency, and contract duration. The second part applied predictive modeling using logistic regression and Random Forest to estimate each clientâ€™s likelihood of churn. Results revealed key risk segments and actionable insights, enabling the design of targeted retention strategies to improve customer loyalty and satisfaction.</p>

        <h3>Identifying Inefficient Operators in CallMeMaybe</h3>
        <p>I analyzed operational data from CallMeMaybe, a virtual telephony service, to identify underperforming operators. I performed exploratory data analysis using call logs and client information to detect patterns such as high missed call counts, long wait times, and low outbound call effectiveness. I also applied statistical tests and created interactive dashboards to validate findings and provide actionable insights, helping supervisors make data-driven decisions to improve overall operational efficiency.</p>

        <h3>Analyzing Airbnb Listings and Pricing Trends</h3>
        <p>I analyzed Airbnb listing data to identify trends in pricing, occupancy, and neighborhood performance. I performed exploratory data analysis to detect patterns in rental prices, availability, and host behavior. I also created interactive visualizations and dashboards to highlight insights, helping hosts and potential investors make data-driven decisions regarding property management and pricing strategies.</p>
